# FlashChat-Firebase

This is a chat app similar to Whatsapp and made with Google Firebase as a back-end server. The users can register, log in, and log out. They can send a message one another. Their all activities such as registration, log in, log out, sending messages are saved to Firebase. Besides, I used Cocoapods and 3rd party libraries in order to use Firebase and design the app. I benefited from IQKeyboardManagerSwift as a 3rd party library to customize the distance from the text field, behaviour of previous, next and done buttons in the keyboard toolbar. I also benefited from .xib file to customise the cells in UITableView. Last but not least, the users' registrations are saved to the Firestore. Hence, when they open the app, their registrations will be loaded automatically.
